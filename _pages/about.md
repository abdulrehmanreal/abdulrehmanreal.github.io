<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am Abdul Rehman, a passionate Data Scientist and AI Researcher specializing in Anomaly Detection and Optimal Transport. I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Data Science from GIFT University, where I developed a strong foundation in machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision. My undergraduate research focused on Anomaly Detection, and the work was accepted at DICTA 2025.

Currently, I am serving as a Lab Instructor at GIFT University, mentoring students in the practical application of artificial intelligence and data science. My research interests lie in developing intelligent, data-driven systems that leverage deep learning, representation learning, and optimal transport theory for robust real-world performance.
